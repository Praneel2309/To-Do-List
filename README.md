## 🔍 Code Structure Overview

The application code is structured into functions that handle specific aspects of task management:

### Core Components

- `struct Task`: Defines the data structure for task information
- `displayIntroAnimation()`: Creates an engaging startup animation
- `displayMenu()`: Shows the colorful main menu
- `addTask()`: Handles new task creation with validation
- `viewTasks()`: Displays all tasks with status indicators
- `sortAndDisplayTasks()`: Enables sorting by priority or due date
- `markCompleted()`: Updates task completion status
- `removeTask()`: Deletes unwanted tasks
- `editTask()`: Modifies existing task information
- `saveTasks()` and `loadTasks()`: Handle file operations for persistence
- `viewCompletedTasks()` and `viewPendingTasks()`: Filter tasks by status

### Data Types Used

- 🧱 **Structs**: The `Task` struct encapsulates all task-related information
- 🧮 **Vectors**: Used for dynamic task collection management
- 🔤 **Strings**: For text data including task names, dates, and times
- 📂 **File Streams**: For reading and writing task data to persistent storage
- 🌈 **ANSI Color Codes**: Constants for UI enhancement

## ⚖️ Design Decisions

| Feature                    | Pros                                            | Cons                                              |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **Console-based UI**       | Simple, lightweight, works on most systems       | Limited graphical capabilities                     |
| **ANSI color formatting**  | Enhances UI without external libraries           | May not work on all console environments           |
| **File-based storage**     | Simple implementation, no database required      | Limited querying capabilities                      |
| **In-memory task list**    | Fast operations, straightforward implementation  | Limited by available memory                        |
| **Text-based input**       | Easy to implement, familiar interface            | Requires validation, prone to input errors         |
